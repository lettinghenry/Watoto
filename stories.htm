               <P><H3>The Old Man's Problem</H3><br/>
               When I went to lunch today, I noticed an old man sitting on a park bench sobbing his eyes out.  I stopped and asked him what was wrong.
He told me, 'I have a 22 year old wife at home. She rubs my back every morning and then gets up and makes me pancakes, sausage, fresh fruit and freshly ground coffee.'

I continued, 'Well, then why are you crying?'

He added, 'She makes me homemade soup for lunch and my favourite biscuits, cleans the house and then watches sports TV with me for the rest of the afternoon.'
I said, 'Well, why are you crying?'
He said, 'For dinner she makes me a gourmet meal with wine and my favourite dessert and then we cuddle until the small hours.'
I inquired, 'Well then, why in the world would you be crying?'
He replied, 'I can't remember where I live.'

               <p><h3>The Road Rats</h3><br/>
    
Police Officer Bryant found a perfect hiding place for watching for speeding motorists.

One day, the officer was amazed when everyone was under the speed limit, so Bryant investigated and found the problem.
  10 year old Dennis was standing on the side of the road with a huge hand painted sign which said "Radar Trap Ahead.
" A little more investigative work led the officer to the boy's accomplice, another boy about 100 yards beyond the radar 
trap with a sign reading "Tips" and a bucket at his feet, full of change.

           <p><h3>The Willful Girl</h3><br/>There was once a little girl who was very wilful and who never obeyed when her elders spoke to her - so how could she be happy?  The Old Witch Brothers Grimm

One day she said to her parents, 'I have heard so much of the old witch that I will go and see her. People say she is a wonderful old woman, and has many marvellous things in her house, and I am very curious to see them.'

But her parents forbade her going, saying, 'The witch is a wicked old woman, who performs many godless deeds - and if you go near her, you are no longer a child of ours.'

The girl, however, would not turn back at her parents' command, but went to the witch's house. When she arrived there the old woman asked her:

'Why are you so pale?' 
'Ah,' she replied, trembling all over, 'I have frightened myself so with what I have just seen.'

'And what did you see?' inquired the old witch. 
'I saw a black man on your steps.'

'That was a collier,' replied she. 
'Then I saw a gray man.'

'That was a sportsman,' said the old woman. 
'After him I saw a blood-red man.'

'That was a butcher,' replied the old woman.

'But, oh, I was most terrified,' continued the girl, 'when I peeped through your window, and saw not you, but a creature with a fiery head.'

'Then you have seen the witch in her proper dress,' said the old woman. 'For you I have long waited, and now you shall give me light.'

So saying the witch changed the little girl into a block of wood, and then threw it on the fire. When it was fully alight, she sat down on the hearth and warmed herself, saying:

'How good I feel! The fire has not burned like this for a long time!' </p><br/>
